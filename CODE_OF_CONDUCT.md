Sony
Japanese tech conglomerate Sony has an informative and extensive code of conduct covering many aspects of working at the company.

It starts with Sony’s purpose and core values, followed by messages from both CEO and Executive Vice President, the second of which poses the question:

“Does this contribute to a better future for Sony and a better future for our society?”

This question, along with Sony’s ethical values of Fairness, Honesty, Integrity, Respect, and Responsibility, form the basis of their code of conduct.

From there, the code of conduct is separated into eight areas:

Core Principles – Honest and Ethical Business Conduct, Relationship with Stakeholders, Respect for Human Rights, and Appreciating Diversity
